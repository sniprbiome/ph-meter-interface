* ph-meter-interface

CLI interface written in python for the consort d230 ph-meter and a pump system made up of "NE-500 oem" pumps from syrringepumps.com. Given a protocol (in an excel format) describing an experimental setup using the ph-meter and a pump system, it can execute said protocol while logging recorded ph-data.

An example of a protocol and a sample output can be seen below:

** TODO Insert protocol image

** TODO Insert image of sample output

* Quick introduction to the ph-meter and pumps

** TODO Describe how the ph-meter has modules and how they are named.

** TODO Describe how the pumps works, also in terms of pump-id's

* Protocol setup

** TODO Describe how to make a protocol

* Installing and starting the program

Install python

Install requirements

Start program using python or a startup script

* How to use

Which settings exists

When startin the program it presents the following options:

1. Set protocol used for run.
2. Calibrate ph-measuring probes.
3. Run selected protocol.
4. Assign new ID's for the pumps.
5. Restart failed run.
6. Live read ph.
7. Exit program


In a typical situation you would first select the desired protocol, then calibrate the ph-probes and finally starting the program.


** TODO Setting the protocol used for the run

** TODO Calibrate ph-measuring probes

** TODO Run selected protocol

** TODO Assign new ID's for the pumps

** TODO Restart failed run

** TODO Live read ph

** TODO Exit program

* TODO Program structure


This is mostly for any future developer of the program.


** General structure
